# Wylies-File-Browser-Resizer

Wylie's File Browser Resizer is a Module for Foundry Virtual Tabletop which enables an option in the settings menu to manually resize the maximum height of the filepicker window. This allows you to ensure it will always fit within your monitor window and prevent you from scrolling off-screen to find the "Choose File" button.

This module is compatible with both v10 and v11.

The module is by default set to a value of 200px, which is very small. In the screenshot above, I chose 400px which fit my monitor nicely.
